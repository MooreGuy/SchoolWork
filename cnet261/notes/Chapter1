The borderless switched network

Can be split into: Core, Distribution, and Access.

Core is the core backbone
Distribution is the connection between core and access
Access is the connection to the user or, connection into or outside
	the network.

Fundamentals of network design have changed from flat to hierarchical

A switched LAN allows:
	more flexibility
	traffic management
	quality of service
	additional security
	support for wireless networking and connectivity
	support for new technologies, such as ip telephony and mobility
		services

LAN Design
	Switch selection based off of:
		fixed, or modular
		stackable, or non-stackable
		thickness of the switch (rack units) | switch form factors
	Business Considerations
		Cost-is dependent on features
		Port-Density-Needs to support appropiate number of devices
		Power-Using PoE to power other things
			  Or redundant power supplies
		Reliability- Needs to provide continuous access
		Port-Speed-concerns speed provided to end-users
		Frame Buffers- Important if there are congested ports to servers
		Scalability- Should provide opportunity for growth
	
Fixed Configuration Switches
	Non upgradable.

Modular Configuration Switches
	Are upgradable
	Can have different size chasis for more upgrades etc.
		Can have added line cards and are expansion slots like pc would
		have
Stackable Configuration Switches
	Switches that can be stacked and connected using a cable
		This stacking technology fron cisco is called StackWise
			Allows up to nine switches
	Stacked switches effectively opperate as a single larger switch
	Stacked switches are good where bandwidth and fault tolerance are
		needed but it is too costly to implement a modular switch.
	Can be daisy chained, but also cross-connected
		if cross-connected then the network can recover quickly if a
			single switch fails.
	Stacked switches use a special port for the stacking cables.
	Stackpower technology allows power sharing among stack members.

The Switched Enviroment
	The concept of switching is universal and can apply to these fields
		LANS, WANS, PSTN(public switched telephone network)

Switching is a decision based on two criteria
	Ingress Port (Where the frame enters the device on a port)
	Destination address 
		This is the destination MAC address of the frames

	The switch looks up the destination port in it's MASTER SWITCHING
		TABLE

Switches build MAC Table using CAM(content addressable memory) table
	CAM is a special type of memory used in high-speed searching
		applications.
	This table is built by recording each address of each device
		connected to it.
	
When a switch recieves a frame with a destination address not in its 
	master switching table.
	The switch forwards the packet out to all ports but the ingress por
		This is called flooding.
	When the device responds to the flood, the switch adds its address
		to the MAC address table.
	
In a network with many interconnected switches, the MAC address table
	contains multiple MAC addresses for a single port connected to the
	other switches.
