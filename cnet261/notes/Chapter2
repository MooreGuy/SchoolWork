/*************************
  INTRO

Switches connect multiple devices, and are responsible for 
	directing and controlling the data flow at the access layer	
	to networked resources.

Cisco switches are "self-configuring" and no additional configurations
	need to be made out of the box.	

	Cisco switches run Cisco IOS thus can be manually configured:
		
		adjusting port speed
		
		bandwidth

		security requirements

Cisco switches can be managed remotely or locally.

	remote management requires:
		IP address
		default gateway

Switches operate at the access layer. The access layer is:

	Uncomplicated: It departments want uncomplicated access to users.
	Most vulnerable area: Very exposed to users.

Because of the previous issues, switches must be secure to protect:
	
	user data
	high speed connections

To achieve this switch security, port security is one of the security
	features that manged switches provide.


/*************************
 	SWITCH BOOT SEQUENCE 
*************************/

When the switch is powered on it goes through the following boot 
	sequence.

	1. POST ( power-on-self-test) is loaded from ROM to check
		CPU subsystems:
			CPU
			DRAM
			portion of the flash device that makes up the flash file
				system

	2. Loads boot loader:
		Small program stored in ROM
		Runs immediately after POST successfully completes

	3. Boot loader performs low-level CPU initilization:
		initializes the CPU registers
			these control where physical memory:

				where it is mapped
				the quantity
				speed

	4. Boot loader initializes the flash file system on the system 
			board.

	5. Boot loader Locates and loads a default IOS operating system 
			software image into memory and hands control of the switch
			over to the IOS.

Boot Loader finds the Cisco IOS image:
	
	Switch attempts to automatically boot using informationin the 
		BOOT enviroment
		
		If this variable is not set, attempts to load and execute
			the first executable file with recursive depth-first search
			in the flash file system.
		
		A depth first search of a directory is each encountered 
			subdirectory is completely searched before continuing the
			search in the original directory.
		
		On Catalyst 2960 the image file is contained in a directory
			that has the same name as the image file (excluding the .bin
			file extension)	

The IOS operating system initializes the interfaces using the Cisco
	commands found in the configuration file, startup configuration
	stored in NVRAM

We can set the BOOT enviroment variable by using:
	
	boot system (global configuration mode command) 

We can view the current IOS boot file is set to by using:
	
	show bootvar (show boot in older IOS versions)


/**********************************
	RECOVERING FROM A SYSTEM CRASH
***********************************/

The boot loader provides access into the switch if the operating system 
	is either:
		missing or damaged system files

	The boot loader has:
		
		A command line 
		access to the files stored in flash memory

To access the boot loader through a console connection follow these
	 steps.
	
	1. connect a PC by console cable to the switch console port.
		 Configure terminal emulation software to connect to the switch.

	2. Unplug the switch the switch power cord.
		
	3. Reconnect the power cord to the switch, within 15 seconds press 
			and hold down the Mode button while the system LED is still
			flashing green.

	4. Continue pressing the Mode button until the System LED turns 
		briefly amber and then solid green, then release it.

	5. The boot loader "switch:" prompt appears in the terminal
		emulator.
	
The boot loader command line supports commands to:
		
	format the flash file system
	reinstall the operating system software
	recover from a lost or forgotten password
	
	the dir command can be used to view a list of files within
		a specified directory

There are several status LED indicator lights on a Cisco switch.
