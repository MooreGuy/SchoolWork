Switches connect multiple devices, and are responsible for 
	directing and controlling the data flow at the access layer	
	to networked resources.

Cisco switches are "self-configuring" and no additional configurations
	need to be made out of the box.	

	Cisco switches run Cisco IOS thus can be manually configured:
		
		adjusting port speed
		
		bandwidth

		security requirements

Cisco switches can be managed remotely or locally.

	remote management requires:
		IP address
		default gateway

Switches operate at the access layer. The access layer is:

	Uncomplicated: It departments want uncomplicated access to users.
	Most vulnerable area: Very exposed to users.

Because of the previous issues, switches must be secure to protect:
	
	user data
	high speed connections

To achieve this switch security, port security is one of the security
	features that manged switches provide.
