Full-Duplex vs Half-Duplex Communication
	
	Full-Duplex improves the performance of a switched LAN

		Allows both ends to transmit and recieve data simultaneously.
			(Also called bidirectional)

		Increases effective bandwidth by 200 percent (100 percent in both
			directions)

		Most Ethernet and Fast Ethernet NICs are sold today offer
			 full-duplex.

		Gigabit Ethernet and 10Gb NICs require full-duplex connections

		In full-duplex, collision detection circuit on the NIC is disabled.

		Method to optimize network performance is called micro-segmentation,
			which is segmenting the network in to micro-segments

			A micro-segment is when you only have one device connected to a
				switch port operating at full-duplex.

			Frames that are sent cannot collide because the devices use two
				seperate cicuits in the network cable.

		Full-duplex requires a switch that supports full-duplex
			configuration or a direct connection using an Ethernet cable 
			between two devices.

	Half-duplex creates performance issues in a switched LAN 
		
		Unidirectional

		communication cannot send and recieve data simultaneously

		Data can only flow one direction at a time, which often causes
			collisions.

		Typically seen in older hardware, like hubs. Full-duplex has
			replaced half-duplex in most hardware.

		Standard, shared hub-based Ethernet configuration efficiency is
			typically rated at 50 to 60
		
Configuring Port Speed and Duplex
	
	Switch ports can be manually configured with specific duplex and speed
		settings
	
	Use the duplex interface configuration mode
		to specify the duplex mode for a switch port. ex. duplex full

	Use the speed interface configuration mode to manually specify the speed
		of the switch port.			ex. speed 100

		The default setting for both duplex and speed for switch ports on 
			Catalyst 2960 and 3560 switches is auto.

		Cisco recommends using auto command for both duplex and speed, to
			avoid connectivity issues between devices.

	The 10/100/1000 ports operate in either half or full duplex mode

		10/100 can operate in either full or half
	
		1000 can only operate in full

		All fiber optic ports such as 100BASE-FX ports operate only at one
			preset speed and are always full-duplex.

	When troubleshooting a device, check the speed and duplex settings.

		Mismatched settings for the duplex mode and speed of switch ports
			can cause connectivity issues. 

		Auto negotiation failure creates mismatched settings.
