SSH Operation

	Secure Shell (SSH) is more secure than telnet

		SSH should replace telnet

		SSH provides an encrypted management connection to a remote device
	
		Attackers cannot grab authentication information if monitoring a 
			connection

		SSH is assigned to port 22
		
		to enable ssh, on a catalyst 2960 switch, the switch must be using
			the version of IOS software inculding cryptographic features
			and capabilities.

			[COMMAND] S1> show version

			if the ios filename includes the combination "k9" then it
				supports encryption
	
	Telnet sends unencrypted login authentication in plain text

		Telnet is assigned to port 23

		If an attacker is monitoring a connection using telnet, they can 
			easliy grab any authentication information that is communicated

Configuring SSH

	1. Verify SSH support		

		use show ip ssh to see if the command exists.

	2. Configure the IP domain

		configure this in global configuration mode using the 
			ip domain-name command ie. cisco.com

		[COMMAND] S1(config)# ip domain-name cisco.com

	3. Generate RSA key pairs

		Not all versions of the Cisco IOS default SSh
		SSH version 1 has known flaws
		
		So to configure we use ip ssh version 2 in global configuration mode
