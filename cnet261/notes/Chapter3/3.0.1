Network Performance is good for productivity in an organization

Improve network performance by seperating large broadcast domains into
	smaller ones.

Routers:

	block broadcast traffic

	but, have limmitted interfaces
	
	primary role: move information between networks

	not their role: provide network access to end devices


Providing access to a LAN is for an access layer switch

A VLAN can reduce the broadcast domain like layer 3 device

VLANS primarily used in LAN, but can be used in MAN, or WANS
