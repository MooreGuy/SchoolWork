/***************************************************************************
	VLAN Definitions
***************************************************************************/

In Switched Network VLANs provide
	
	provide segmentation and organizational flexibility

	Group devices within a LAN
	
		Grouped devices communicate as if attached to same wire.

	Logical Connections, instead of physical


Allows Admin to segment network based on: 

	Function

	Project Team

	Application

	And	Not on physical location of the device


Devices in VLAN act as if they are on their own independent network, despite
	common infastructure with other VLANS


Any Switch port can only do the following within the VLAN:

	Belong to a VLAN

	unicast packets

	broadcast packets

	multicast packets	


Each VLAN = separate logical network, so packets going outside the VLAN
	need to be forwarded through a device that supports routing.

VLANs do the following:

	create logical broadcast domain; can span multiple physical LAN segments
		
	improve network performance by separating large broadcast domains	

	Broadcast frames are recieved by everyone on that VLAN, but not other 
		VLANS

	Enable the implementation of access security policies by user groupings

Each port on a VLAN can only be assigned to one VLAN, 
	EXCEPT port connected to:  IP phone, or Switch

/***************************************************************************
	Benefits of VLANS
***************************************************************************/

User Productivity and network adaptability are important to business

VLANS provide:

	Security:
	
		Groups with sensative data can be separated from others.

		This reduces the chance of a breach of sensative data.

	Cost Reduction:

		reduced need for expensive network upgrades

		efficient use of existing bandwidth and uplings

	Better Performance:
		
		Divide to logical workgroups (broadcast domains) reduce unnecessary
			traffic

	Shrink Broadcast Domains:

	Improved IT Staff Efficiency:

		Easier to manage netowrk

		policies and precudures configured for VLANs on new switch when
			ports are assigned.

		easy to identify; can be assigned a name

	Simpler Project and Application Management:

		aggregate devices to support business or geographic requirements

		has seperate functions; managing a project or working with a
			specialized application easier


Hierarchical network-addressing scheme;

	each VLAN = IP network

	Design must take into considerations hierarchical network-addressing
		scheme

	Hierarchical network addressing = IP network numbers are applied to the
		network segments in an orderly fashion that takes the network as a
		whole into consideration.

	Blocks of contiguous network addressing are reserved for and configured
		on devices in a specific area of the network.


/***************************************************************************
	TYPES OF VLANS
***************************************************************************/

Defined by traffic classes, or by function they serve.

DATA VLAN:

	Configured to carry user-generated traffic.

	WOULD NOT BE A VLAN carrying voice, or management traffic

		Common practice to seperate these two from data

	Sometimes referred to as User VLAN.

	Used to seperate the network into groups of users or devices

Default VLAN:

	All switch ports become part of the default VLAN after switch loading
		default configuration

	The default VLAN for cisco switches is VLAN 1

	VLAN 1 has all the features of any VLAN except it cannot be renamed or
		deleted.

	By default all Layer 2 control traffic is associated with VLAN 1

Native VLAN:

	A native VLAN is assigned to an 802.1Q trunk port.

	Trunk ports are the links between switches that support the transmission
		of traffic associated with more than one VLAN

	An 802.1Q trunk port supports traffic coming from many VLANS(tagged
		traffic), as well as traffic that does not come from a VLAN
		(untagged traffic)

	An 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN, which
		by default is VLAN 1

	Native VLANS are defined in the IEEE 802.1Q specification to maintain
		backward compatibility with untagged traffic common to legacy LAN
		scenarios.

	A native VLan serves as a common identifier on opposite ends of a trunk
		link.

	It is best practice to configure the native VLAN as an unused VLAN,
		distinct from VLAN 1 and other VLANS. In fact, is is not
		unusual to dedicate a fixed VLAN to serve the role of the native
		VLAN for all trunk ports in the switched domain.

Management VLAN

	Any VLAN configured to access management capabilities of a switch.

	VLAN 1 is the management VLAN by default.

	To create the management VLAN, the switch virtual interface (SVI)
		is assigned an IP address and a subnet mask which allows the switch
		to be managed by: HTTP, Telnet, SSH, or SNMP.

	Since cisco out-of-the-box is VLAN 1 as the default VLAN, VLAN 1 would
		be a bad choice for the management VLAN

	In the past, the management VLAN for a 2960 switch was the only active
		SVI.

	On  15.x versions for 2960 it is possible to have more than one active
		SVI

	On 15.x the active SVI must be documented.

	Theoretically a switch can have more than one SVI, but increases
		exposure to network attacks.

/***************************************************************************
	VOICE VLANS	
***************************************************************************/

A separate VLAN is needed to support(VoIP).

VoIP traffic requires:

    Assured bandwidth to ensure voice quality

    Transmission priority over other types of network traffic

    Ability to be routed around congested areas on the network

    Delay of less than 150 ms across the network

To meet these requirements, the entire network has to be designed to support
	VoIP.

 The details of how to configure a network to support VoIP are beyond the
	 scope of this course, but it is useful to summarize how a voice VLAN
	 works between a switch, a Cisco IP phone, and a computer.

In the figure, VLAN 150 is designed to carry voice traffic. The student computer PC5 is attached to the Cisco IP phone, and the phone is attached to switch S3. PC5 is in VLAN 20, which is used for student data.
