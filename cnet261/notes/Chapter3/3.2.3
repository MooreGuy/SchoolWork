Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

    Trunk interfaces support different trunk modes.

        trunking, nontrunking, or negotiate trunking

    DTP is
    
        point to point

        Cisco proprietary protocol.

            Other vendors do not support it. 

        Automatically enabled on Catalyst 2960, and 3560

            This is enabled as [dynamic auto]

        Manages trunk negotiation only if the other switch port is
            configured in a trunk mode that supports DTP.

        CAUTION: Some devices might forward DTP frames improperly, which
            can cause misconfigurations. Turn off DTP to devices that 
            don't support it.
