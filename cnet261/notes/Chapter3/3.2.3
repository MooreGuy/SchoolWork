Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

    Trunk interfaces support different trunk modes.

        trunking, nontrunking, or negotiate trunking

    DTP is
    
        point to point

        Cisco proprietary protocol.

            Other vendors do not support it. 

        Automatically enabled on Catalyst 2960, and 3560

            This is enabled as [dynamic auto]

        Manages trunk negotiation only if the other switch port is
            configured in a trunk mode that supports DTP.

        CAUTION: Some devices might forward DTP frames improperly, which
            can cause misconfigurations. Turn off DTP to devices that 
            don't support it. 

			For devices that don't support DTP use this to make them a trunk
				but not send DTP frames:

				[COMMANDS] S1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
			
				[COMMANDS] S1(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate 

Interface Modes

	/*BEST PRACTICE*/

		Configure trunk links statically whenever possible.
		
		Set  trunks to trunk and nonegotiate when a trunk link is required.

		On links where trunking is not intended, DTP should be turned off

		Default DTP is dependent on the Cisco IOS version and the platform.

			To determine current DTP mode use:

				[COMMAND]S1# show dtp interface

	/*BEST PRACTICE*/

	switchport mode access : permanent nontrunking mode

			limited connectivity with a trunk port connected to it
		
	switchport mode trunk : permanent trunking mode

			limited connectivity with a access port connected to it.
		
	switchport mode dynamic auto : Auto configures, prefers trunks

	switchport mode dynamic desirable : Auto configures, prefers access
