Don't leave ports on default VLAN 1

	Put unused ports on a different VLAN than 1 too (black-hole VLAN)

Shut down ports not being used

Seperate management and user data traffic
	
	Default VLAN 1, but should be changed

To communicate remotely with a Cisco switch for management it must have:

	IP address configured on the management VLAN

Users would not be able to try remote acceess if they aren't in the
	management VLAN, so it provides another layer of security

Change native VLAN from 1, and it shouldn't be used for anything else

	Should be the same on all ends

DTP offers four modes

	access

	trunk
	
	dynamic auto

	dynamic desirable

Disable autonegotiate

Don't use dynamic auto or dynamic desirable

Voice traffic has QoS requirements so it should be seperated from data
	traffic
