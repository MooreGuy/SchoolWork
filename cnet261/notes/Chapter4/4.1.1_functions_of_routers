First about networks...

	Networks impact our lives...

	Networks allow us to: (I swear, I should just copy paste this stuff)

		communicate, collaborate, interact in ways we never did before

		We use it in many ways:

			web apps, IP telephony, video conferencing, interactive gaming,
				electronic commerce, education, and more


	Network characteristics:

		Topology - 
		
			physical: arrangement of the cables, network devices and end
						systems. describes how things are wired.

			logical: describes how the network devices appear connected to
						network users, or the path which data is transfered

		Speed -

			data rate in bits per second (b/s) of a given link in
				the network

			should not vary

			not network bandwidth

		Cost - 

			general expense for purchasing of network
				components, and installation and maintenance of the network

		Security - 

			how protected the network is, including the information that 
				is sent on the network.

			Important, and contantly evolving.


		Availability - 

			measure of the probability that the network is available for use
				when it is required

		Scalability -

			how easy network can accommodate more users.
			
			can be very expensive if a network is not scalable.

		Reliability -

			dependability of the components that make up the network,
				
			measured as a probability of failure as the mean time between
				failures (MTBF)

Why Routing? (YEAH WHY NOT USE DOGES? DOGES ARE MUCH, VERY, and SO BETTER)	

	Communication between networks would not be possible without a router

	(well that was simple..)

Routers are computers (WHAAAAA???!?!?!?!)

	Most network devices need the following to operate

		CPU, OS, Memory and storage (RAM, ROM, NVRAM, Flash, Hard Drive

		So router is specialized computer (like doge is specialized dog)
	
Routers use the following to store things and here is why

	RAM (Random Access Memory) -
	
		Temporary storage for: Appilcations, processes, IOS, running-config,
			various tables(routing table, arp table), buffers

		Volatile; loses contents when powered off

	ROM (Read-Only Memory) -

		Permanent storage for: bootup instructions, basic diagnostic
			software, limited IOS in case router can't load full IOS

		Non-volatile; Firmware; doesn't lose contents when powered off

	NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) 

		Permanent storage for: startup-config

		Non-volatile; doesn't lose contents when powered off

	Flash -

		permanent storage for: IOS and other system-related files.

			IOS is copied from flash into RAM during the bootup process.

		Non-volatile; doesn't lose contenst when powered off

Routers connect networks (Yes enough already..oh.. it might be on the test?)

	Connects multiple networks- so multiple interfaces can be used

		can connect to final destination, or another router used to reach
			the destination network

	Normally each network requires an interface

		connect a combination of both LANs and WANs

Routers choose best paths

	Determine best path, then forward packets based on those decisions.

	Uses routing table to determine best path.
		
		These are built using static and dynamic routing protocols to learn
			about networks
		
	Examines destination address of packet then looks at routing table

	Router can forward and recieve packets in different encapsulation types

		such as : Ethernet, PPP, Frame Relay, DSL, cable, and 802.11

Packet Forwarding Mechanisms

	Routers support three packet-forwarding mechanisms

	Process Switching -

		older, still available for cisco routers

		When packet arrives on an interface:

			forwarded to the control plane where CPU matches the destination
				address with an entry in its routing table

			determines exit interface and forwards the packet

			This is performed for every packet, even if it is in a stream

		very slow

	Fast switching -

		common packet forwarding mechanism

		uses fast-switching cache to store next-hop information

		When a packet arrives on an interface:

			forwarded to the control plane where cPU searches for a match in
				the fast-switching cache

				if it is not there, it process-switched and forwarded to the
					exit interface

		Flow information for the packet is also stored in the fast-switching
			cache so if another packet going to the same destination arrives
			on an interface, the next-hop information in the cache is 
			re-used without CPU intervention

		Cisco Express Forwarding(CEF) -

			CEF most recent and prefered Cisco forwarding mechanism

			Builds a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) like fast switching

				FIB contains pre-computed reverse lookups, next hop
					information for routes including the interface and 
					layer 2 information

			Builds an adjacency table.

			Table entries are not packet-triggered like fast switching, 
				but change-triggered, such as network topology changing

			When a network has converged, FIB and adjacency tables contain
				all the information a router would have to consider when
				forwarding a packet.
	
			Fastest forwarding mechanism and the preferred choice for
				cisco routers.

			Cisco Analogies for them:

				Process switching solves a problem by doing math long hand,
					even if it is the identical problem

				Fast switching solves a problem by doing math long hand
					one time and remembering the answer for subsequent
					identical problems
		
				CEF solves every possible problem ahead of time in a
					spreadsheet
