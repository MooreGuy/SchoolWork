Connecting Devices

	Weird example of how things can connect: (didn't even bother)


		Network devices and end users typically connect to a network using a wired Ethernet or wireless connection. Refer to the figure as a sample reference topology. The LANs in the figure serve as an example of how users and network devices could connect to networks.

		Home office devices can connect as follows:

		Laptops and tablets connect wirelessly to a home router.

		A network printer connects using an Ethernet cable to the switch port on the home router.

		The home router connects to the service provider cable modem using an Ethernet cable.

		The cable modem connects to the Internet service provider (ISP) network.

	The Branch site devices connect as follows:

		Corporate resources (i.e., file servers and printers) connect to Layer 2 switches using Ethernet cables.

		Desktop PCs and voice over IP (VoIP) phones connect to Layer 2 switches using Ethernet cables.

		Laptops and smartphones connect wirelessly to wireless access points (WAPs).

		The WAPs connect to switches using Ethernet cables.

		Layer 2 switches connect to an Ethernet interface on the edge router using Ethernet cables. An edge router is a device that sits at the edge or boundary of a network and routes between that network and another, such as between a LAN and a WAN.

		The edge router connects to a WAN service provider (SP).

		The edge router also connects to an ISP for backup purposes.

	The Central site devices connect as follows:

		Desktop PCs and VoIP phones connect to Layer 2 switches using Ethernet cables.

		Layer 2 switches connect redundantly to multilayer Layer 3 switches using Ethernet fiber-optic cables (orange connections).

		Layer 3 multilayer switches connect to an Ethernet interface on the edge router using Ethernet cables.

		The corporate website server is connected using an Ethernet cable to the edge router interface.

		The edge router connects to a WAN SP.

		The edge router also connects to an ISP for backup purposes.

		In the Branch and Central LANs, hosts are connected either directly or indirectly (via WAPs) to the network infrastructure using a Layer 2 switch.


Default Gateways

	To enable network access devices must be configured with:

		IP address- Identifies a unique host on a local network

		Subnet Mask - Identifies with which network subnet the host can
				communicate

		Default Gateway - Identifies the router to send a packet to when
				the destination is not on the same local network subnet

	When host sends packet to device on same IP network:

		packet is forwarded out of the host interface to the destination 
			device

	When a host sends packets to a device on a different IP network,

		packet is forwarded to the default gateway since host device
			cannot communicate with devices outside of the network directly

		Default gateway is the destination that routes traffic from the
			local network to devices on remote networks. 
	
			often connects local devices to the internet

		Default gateway usually address of the interface on the router
			connected to the local network.

		Router maintains routing table entries of all connected networks
			as well as entries of remote networks, determines best path with
			routing table

		Routers also have default gateway, sometimes called Gateway of
			Last Resort

Document Network Addressing

	Documentation of a new or existing network should contain at least:

		Device Names

		Interfaces used in the design

		IP addressing and subnet masks

		Default gateway addresses

	Can either be:

		Topology Diagram - Provides visual reference that indicates the
			physical connectivity and logical layer 3 addressing.

			Created using software, like Visio

		An Addressing table - A table that has device names, interfaces,
			IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, and default gateway addresses
