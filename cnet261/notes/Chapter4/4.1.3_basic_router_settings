Configure Basic Router Settings

	Cisco Routers and switches have: modal operating system, similar
		command structures, similiar initial configuration steps and many
		 of the same commands, in common

	When configuring a router basic tasks are:

		Name the device: Distinguish it from other routers

		Secure management access- secures privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and
									Telnet access, and encrypts passwords
									to their highest level.

		Configure a banner - provides legal notification of unauthorized
							access.

		Save changes, then verify configuration

	distinguishing feature between switch and router is the type of 
		interfaces supported by each.

		Switches support LANS and have multiple FE and GE ports

	
		Routers support LANs and WANs and can interconnect different types
			of networks and have man interfaces

			like G2 ISRs, have one or two integrated Gigabit Ethernet
			
			 High-Speed WAN Interface Card (HWIC) to accomidate others like
				Serial, DSL, and cable interfaces


	To be available an interface must be:

		configured with iPv4 address and subnet mask

		activated, issue no shutdown, and make sure it is on at the 
			physical layer (there is another device that is connected)

			by default LAN and WAN interfaces are not activated


		OPTIONAL: could have a short description

			Good practice to make one for each interface

			Limited to 240 chars.

			In production can be helpful for troubleshooting like:

				information on: type of network the interface is connected
					to

				if it connects to third party or ISP or service carrier,
					helpful to put in contact info

		Depending on type of interface, could have more parameters.

			Serial DCE must be configured with clock rate command

				NOTE:NOT DTE, provideds error %Error: This command only...
