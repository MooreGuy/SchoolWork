Configure Basic Router Settings

	Cisco Routers and switches have: modal operating system, similar
		command structures, similiar initial configuration steps and many
		 of the same commands, in common

	When configuring a router basic tasks are:

		Name the device: Distinguish it from other routers

		Secure management access- secures privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and
									Telnet access, and encrypts passwords
									to their highest level.

		Configure a banner - provides legal notification of unauthorized
							access.

		Save changes, then verify configuration


	distinguishing feature between switch and router is the type of 
		interfaces supported by each.

		Switches support LANS and have multiple FE and GE ports

	
		Routers support LANs and WANs and can interconnect different types
			of networks and have man interfaces

			like G2 ISRs, have one or two integrated Gigabit Ethernet
			
			 High-Speed WAN Interface Card (HWIC) to accomidate others like
				Serial, DSL, and cable interfaces


Configure an IPv4 Router Inerface

	To be available an interface must be:

		configured with iPv4 address and subnet mask

		activated, issue no shutdown, and make sure it is on at the 
			physical layer (there is another device that is connected)

			by default LAN and WAN interfaces are not activated

		OPTIONAL: could have a short description

			Good practice to make one for each interface

			Limited to 240 chars.

			In production can be helpful for troubleshooting like:

				information on: type of network the interface is connected
					to

				if it connects to third party or ISP or service carrier,
					helpful to put in contact info

		Depending on type of interface, could have more parameters.

			Serial DCE must be configured with clock rate command

				NOTE:NOT DTE, provideds error %Error: This command only...

Configure an IPv6 Router Interface

	Similar to IPv4

	IPv6 must be configured with an address and a subnet mask
	[COMMANDS]R1(config-if)# ipv6 address [ipv6-address/prefix-length]
		[link-local | eui-64]

	must be activated	

		no shutdown

	Interface can generate its own IPv6 link-local address without having a
		global unicast address by using:

		[COMMANDS]R1(config-if)# ipv6 enable

	IPv6 typically have more than one IPv6 address

		Minimum, must have link-local
		
		could have global unicast address.

	IPv6 supports interface having multiple IPv6 global unicast addresses
		from the same subnet

	Commands to statically create a global unicast or link-local IPv6
		address

		[COMMANDS]

			ipv6 address [ipv6-address] [prefix-length]
				
				creates a global unicast IPv6 address as specified

			ipv6 address [ipv6-address] [prefix-length] eui-64

				configures a global unicast IPv6 address with an interface
					IP in the low-order 64 bits of the IPv6 address using
					the EUI-64 process

			ipv6 address [ipv6 address] [prefix-length] link-local
			
				configures a static link-local address on the interface
					that is used instead of the link-local address that
					is automatically configured when the global unicast
					IPv6 address is assigned to the interface or enabled
					using the ipv6 enable interface command. Recall the
					ipv6 enable interface command is used to automaticaly
					create an IPv6 link-local address whether or not an
					IPv6 global unicast address has been assigned

	When a router is configured with:
		[COMMAND]R1(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing 

		router begins sending ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages out the
			interface

			enables a PC connected to the interface to automatically
				configure an IPv6 address and to set the default gateway
				without needing the services of a DHCPv6 server.

			Alternatively, PC connected to the IPv6 network can get
				its IPv6 address statically assigned

	Default Gateway is IPv6 global unicast address of Rrouter interface

Configure IPv4 Loopback interface

	Common configuration

	Loopback interface is logical interface internal to the router

		Not assigned to a physical port

		can therefore never be connected to any other device

		considered software interface that is automatically placed in an 
			UP state, as long as the router is functioning

	Loopback is useful for:

		testing, and managing Cisco device b/c ensures that at least one
			interface will always be available

		example: can be used for testing purposes: testing internal routing
			processes by emulating networks behind the router

	IPv4 address asigned to it can be significant to processes on the
		router that use an interface address for identifacction

		OSPF routing process.

	By enabling loopback, router will always use the available loopback
		interface address for identification, rather than a phyiscal 
		port that could go down.

	Multiple loopback interfaces can be enabled on a router
	
	the address for each loopback interface must be unique and unused by
		 any other interface

	[COMMANDS]

		R1(config)# interface loopback [number]

		R1(config-if)# ip address [ip-address] [subnet-mask]

		R1(config-if)# exit

Verify Connectivity of Directly Connected Networks

	Use commands these three commands to verify:

		show ip interface brief - display summary of all interfaces
			including IPv4 addresses of the interface and current 
				Operation status

		show ip route - displays the contents of IPv4 routing table stored
			in RAM. In Cisco IOS 15, active interfaces should appear in
			the routing table with two related entries identified by the
			code 'C' (connected) or 'L' (Local). In previous versions
			only a single entry with the 'C' code appear

		show running-config interface [interface-id] - Displays the
			commands configured on the specified interface

	show ip interface brief: Status of "up" and protocol "up" means it is
		good, anything else would be down. Either configuration or cabling

	show ip route: local host route has an administrative distance of 0
		also has /32 mask for IPv4 and /128 mask for IPv6. Local host
		route is for routes on the router owning the IP address, used
		to allow the router to process packets destined to that IP.

	show running-config interface: Output displays current commands on
		interface

	If you need more info

		show interface - info about packet flow count for all interfaces

		show ip interface - displays IPv4 related information for all
			interfaces on a router

Verify IPv6

	show ipv6 interface brief: the up/up shows layer1/layer2 status same as
		IPv4 status and protocol columsn

	if two configured IPv6 addresses per interface are show,

		one is for global unicast that was manually entered, 
		
		the other, which begins with FE80, is the link-local unicast
			address for the interface

			this is added whenever a global unicast address is assigned

			IPv6 network interface is required to have link-local but not
				necessarily a global unicast address

	show ipv6 interface gigabit ethernet 0/0: displays interface status
		and all IPv6 addresses belonging to the interface.

		Also shows multicast addresses assigned to the interface, beginning
			with prefix FF02

	show ipv6 route : used to verify IPv6 networks and specific IPv6
		interface addresses have been installed in the IPv6 routing table
		
		only displays IPv6 routes, not IPv4

		In routing table 'C' is directly connected network

		When a router is configured with a global unicast address and is
			in the "up/up" state, the IPv6 prefix and prefix length is
			added to the IPv6 routing table as a connected route

		The IPv6 global unicast address configured on the interface is also
			installed in the routing table as a local route. The local
			route has a /128 prefix. Local routes are used by routing
			tables to efficiently process packets with the interface
			address of the router as the destination

	ping command for ipv6 is identical to ipv4 except an ipv6 address is 
		used.

Filtering show commands

	commands that generate multiple lines of output are by default paused
		after 24 lines. 

		at the end of the pause the --More-- text displays

		pressing enter displays the next line adn pressing the spacebar
		displays the next set of lines.


	Use: [COMMAND] terminal length [number] command to specify the number
		of lines to be displayed

		A value of 0 prevents the prouter from pausing between screens
			of output	

	Filter commands to display sections of out put with the pipe (|)
		after the show command and then enter a filtering parameter
		and a filtering expression

		Filtering parameters:

			section - show entire section that start with the expression

			include - include all output lines that match expression

			exclude - exculdes all lines matching expression

			begin - shows output lines from certain point starting with
					line matched by expression

Command History

	temporarily stores list of executed commands to be recalled

	To recall commands: press Ctrl+P or the Up Arrow key

		begins with most recent command

		repeat key sequence to recall successively oldrer commands

	To return to more recent commands: Ctrl+N, or Down Arrow key
		
		repeat to get more new commands

	Default: history is enabled and captures last 10 commands

	Use:[COMMAND]R1# show histor // to display the contents of the buffer

	Practical to increase buffer for current term session only.

		Use [COMMAND]R1# terminal history size [size]
		
			increase or decrease
