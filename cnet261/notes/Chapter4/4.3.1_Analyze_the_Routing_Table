Routing Table

	Directly connected routes

		Routes come from the active router interfaces

		Routers add a directly connected route when an interface is
			configured with an IP address and is activated

	Remote Routes -

		remote networks connected to other routers

		either, static or dynamic

	Routing Table is a data file in RAM that is used to store route
		information about directly connected and remote networks

		contains network, or next hop associations

			tell router a particular destination can be optimally reached
				by sending the packet to a specific router that
				represents the next hop on the way to the final destination

			next hop assocaition can also be the outgoing or exit interface
				to the next destination

Routing Table Sources
	
	[COMMAND]R1# show ip route 

		used to display the IPv4 routing table of a router

		privdes additional route information, including how
		
			the route was learned

			long the route has been in the table

			which specific interface to use to get to a predefined
				destination

	Entries in the routing table can be added as:

		Local Route interfaces- Added when an interface is configured and
			active

		Directly connected interfaces - Added to the routing table when
			an interface is configured and active.

		Static routes - Added when a route is manually configured and the
			exit interface is active.

		Dynamic routing protocol - Added when routing protocols that
			dynamically learn about the network, such as EIGRP or OSPF,
			are implemented and networks are identified



	Codes showing how routes were learned.

		L - address assigned to a router's interface, allows it to 
			efficiently determine when i t recieves a packet for the
			interface instead of being forwarded

		C - Identifies a directly connected network

		S - a static route

		D - Dynamically learned using EIGRP

		O - dynamically learned using OSPF	

Remote Network Routing Entries

	Route source - how the route was learned

	Destination network - the address of the remote network

	Administrative distance - the trustworthiness of the remote network

		Lower is prefered
	
	Metric - The value assigned to reach the remote network

		lower is better

	Next-Hop - Ipv4 address of the next router to forward the pack to

	Route timestamp - how much time has passed since the route was learned

	Outgoing interface - exit interface to use to forward a packet toward
							the final destination
