Directly connected Interfaces

	Newly deployed router without any configured interfaces has nothing in 
		its routing table

	Before an interface is considered up/up and added to the IPv4 routing
		table, the interface must:

		be assigned a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address

		be activated with the no shutdown command

		Receive a carrier signal from another device (router, switch, host,
			etc.)

	When the device is up, it is added to the routing table as a directly
		connected network

Directly Connected Routing table Entries

	An active, properly configured, directly connected interface creates
		two routing table entries

	Routing table for direct interfaces is simpler than for remote

		Route Source - Identifies how the route was learned

			'C' is directly connected network

			'L' identifies the IPv4 address assigned to the router's
				interface

		Destination network - The address of the remote network

		Outgoing interface - identifies the exit interface to use when
								forwarding packets to the destination
									network.

		Prior to IOs 15 L were not displayed, but were in IPv6
