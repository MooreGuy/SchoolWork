Static Routes

	After direct routes are added, then static or dynamic routes can be
		added

	Static routes are manually configured

	Define an explicit path between two networking devices

	Unlike dynamic routing protocol, static routes are not automatically
		updated

		must be manually reconfigured if the topology changes
			
			this is the main disadvantage

		no CPU cycles are used to calculate and communicate routes

		Identified in routing table with 'S'

	Two types of static routes

		Static route to a specific network

		Default static routes

	To make a static route

		[COMMANDs]

		R1(config)# ip route [network] [mask] [next-hop-ip | exit intf]

	Default static route is similar to default gateway on a host

		default static route specifies the exit point to use when the 
			routing tbale does not contain a path for the destination
			network

	Default static route is useful when a router has only one exit point
		to another router. like connecting to central router or service
		router

	to configure a static route use:

		[COMMANDS]

		R1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [exit-intf | next-hop=ip]
