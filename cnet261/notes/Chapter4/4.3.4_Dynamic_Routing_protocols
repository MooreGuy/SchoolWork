Dynamic Routing

	Dynamic routing is used by routers share information about reachability
		and status of remote networks

		Perform several actions, network discovery, maintain routing tables

	Network discovery: ability to share information about the networks
		that a routing protocol knows about.

		automatically learn about these networks
		
		then added to routing table

	During network discovery routers exchange routes, and update their 
		routing tables, routers have converged after they have finished
		exchanging and updating their routing tables. Routers then maintain
		the networks in their routing tables

IPv4 Routing protocols

	picks best path

	Can also pick best path if initial path is unusable(if topology change)

	dynamic routing protocols automatically share routing information
		with other routers and compensate for any topology changes

Cisco ISR routers can support a variety of dynamic IPv4 routing protocols
	including

	EIGRP- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

	OSPF - Open Shortest Path First

	IS-IS - Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System

	RIP - Routing information Protocol

	To determine which routing protocols are supported by the IOS, use

	[COMMAND]R1(config)# router ?

	Example

		D - EIGRP route

		* - means it is a candidate for Default Route

		EX - means it is an external route forwarded by EIGRP

IPv6 routing protocols

	RIPng(Rip next generation)

	OSPFv3
	
	EIGRP for IPv6

	To enable IPv6 routers to forward traffic, you must configure the

		[COMMAND]R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing

	To show iPv6 routes use:

		[COMMANd]R1# show ipv6 route
