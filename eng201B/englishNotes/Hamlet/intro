Hamlett is essentially a murder mystery, somebody murdered the king. 
So it is crime and punishment. It also is a ghost story, his father 
returns to haunt him. It's a revenge story. It's a tragic love story, 
Hamlett and Ofelia, commits suicide, and he is murdered. (all great 
tragedies are family tragedies) Politcal thriller, lots of spying. 
It's a commedy, lost of humour involved to encompass a wide audience.

first produced in 1601, and has been in continual production since then,
 so for 413 years.
