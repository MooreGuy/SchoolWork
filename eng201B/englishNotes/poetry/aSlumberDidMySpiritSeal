A slumber did my spirit seal; 
I had no human fears: 
She seemed a thing that could not feel 
The touch of earthly years. 

No motion has she now, no force; 
She neither hears nor sees; 
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course, 
With rocks, and stones, and trees. 


This poem is about the death and the eventual burial of the
writer. He is acknowledging death as female, which is 
common in some places. And then in the end it mentions
that the author is being burried because they are now
one with the elements of the earth such as rocks, stones
and trees.
