True ease in writing comes from Art, not Chance, 
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance. 
'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence; 
The sound must seem an echo to the sense. 
Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows, 
And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows; 
But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, 
The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar. 
When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, 
The line, too, labours, and the words move slow: 
Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain, 
Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main. 
Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise, 
And bid alternate passions fall and rise! 
While at each change the son of Libyan Jove 
Now burns with glory, and then melts with love; 
Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow, 
Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow: 
Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found, 
And the world's Victor stood subdued by sound! 
The power of music all our hearts allow, 
And what Timotheus was is Dryden now. 

Avoid extremes, and shun the fault of such 
Who still are pleas'd too little or too much. 
At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence; 
That always shows great pride or little sense: 
Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best 
Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest. 
Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move; 
For fools admire, but men of sense approve: 
As things seem large which we thro' mist descry, 
Dulness is ever apt to magnify.  (1711)
