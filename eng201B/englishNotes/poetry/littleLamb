Little Lamb, who made thee? 
Dost thou know who made thee? 
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed, 
By the stream and o'er the mead; 
Gave thee clothing of delight, 
Softest clothing, woolly, bright; 
Gave thee such a tender voice, 
Making all the vales rejoice? 
Little Lamb, who made thee? 
Dost thou know who made thee? 
Little Lamb, I'll tell thee, 
Little Lamb, I'll tell thee. 
He is called by thy name, 
For He calls Himself a Lamb. 
He is meek, and He is mild; 
He became a little child. 
I a child, and thou a lamb, 
We are called by His name. 
Little Lamb, God bless thee! 
Little Lamb, God bless thee! 

This poem, "The Lamb", is a poem about a lamb and he is
asking the lamb whether he knows who has created it. The lamb
is a gentle and docile creature that is very sweet and
almost delicate. He is saying that the thing that has made
the lamb is also this, and that he was a mortal.
It is most likely that he is referring to god  or something
religious.
