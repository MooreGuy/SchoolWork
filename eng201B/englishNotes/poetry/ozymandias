I met a traveler from an antique land 
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, 
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, 
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, 
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read 
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, 
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; 
And on the pedestal these words appear: 
“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
Look upon my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” 
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare 
The lone and level sands stretch far away. 

The author comes apon a giant stone statue, but all that 
remains of it is the legs and a plaque on it. The author
says that it is of a dicatator figure, which had a cold, and
commanding attitude to him as his plaque even read that one
should fear his might. Ironically the works are now in ruins 
and all that remains to show of ozymandius's great power
is just sand and bleak sand.
