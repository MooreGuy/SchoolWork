The author begins by saying that the country is not a place for old 
men. He says that old men aren't much except for a stick and tattered 
set of clothing. He then goes on to say that if they can sing, or do
some kind of art, then they are eternalized. He says that he wants 
to follow this wish of his to be eternalized by his singing by going
to byzantium.
