Walt Witman | Song of Myself

	Made during the age of reason, going away from the age of reason.
		This is referencing the thnking of time period to more democracy
			Makes use of the word or, often at the beginning of the sentences.
			Puts names of caucasian with native americans, showing equality and democracy.
	No meter in the poem, nothng alike to the European poets.
		His idea of poetry was rather being able to connect things
	He is trying to compare the blade of grass that a child gives him to anything he can
	People questioned his poetry, because it didn't rhyme and they didn't quite understand
		what he was trying to do.
