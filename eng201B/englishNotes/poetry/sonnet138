When my loves swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties. 
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
O love’s best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love loves not t’have years told.
Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.

This is an ironic sonnet that depicts the problem of having a lover that
lies to him even though he knows she does, but he doesn't want to
expose her lies as she might admit that he is old, and so both sides
a truth is suppressed or both lovers are lying to one another.

He goes on to say that love's best habit is seeming trust, or that the
best thing in love is that they both falsely believe in trust.

The ending Quartrain is a pun, as to lie could also mean to lie in bed,
as well as lie in the literal meaning of the word.
And they are still falttered by their lying.
