That time of year thou mayst in me behold 
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, 
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. 
In me thou seest the twilight of such day 
As after sunset fadeth in the west, 
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest. 
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire 
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, 
As the death-bed whereon it must expire 
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by. 
This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

The first Quatrain he is comparing the season to his old age. Or in this
case he is comparing his old age to Autumn. 

In the second Quatrain he compares his fading self to twilight on a 
day. 

He then describes how his inner fire is consuming the fuel which he was
nourished on, and one day it will expire.

In the last Quatrain he pleas that who is speaking to must love more 
strongly knowing that the speaker must part soon.
