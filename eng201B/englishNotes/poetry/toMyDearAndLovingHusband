If ever two were one, then surely we. 
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;  
If ever wife was happy in a man,  
Compare with me, ye women, if you can. 
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold  
Or all the riches that the East doth hold. 
My love is such that rivers cannot quench, 
Nor ought but love from thee, give recompense. 
Thy love is such I can no way repay, 
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.  
Then while we live, in love let's so persevere 
That when we live no more, we may live ever.


This poem is about a wife saying that they are certainly 
close together and that she does love him a lot but she
is pleaing for him to love in a way that they could love
forever. So just don't screw it up.
