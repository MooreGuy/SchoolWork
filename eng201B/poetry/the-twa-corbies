 I was walking all alane
I heard twa corbies makin' mane
And t'ane untae the t'other did say-oh
Where shall we gang and dine the day-oh
Where shall we gang and dine the day

In behind yon auld fail dyke
I wot there lies a new-slain knight
And naebody kens that he lies there-oh
But his hawk and hound and his lady fair-oh
His hawk and hound and his lady fair

His hound is tae the hunting gane
His hawk tae fetch the wild fowl hame
His lady's taen another mate-oh
So we may make our dinner sweet-oh
We may make our dinner sweet

Ye'll sit on his white haus-bane
And I'll pike out his bonny blue e'en
With many a lock of his golden hair-oh
We'll theek our nest when it grows bare-oh
We'll theek our nest when it grows bare

Many a one for him makes mane
But naen shall ken where he has gane
O'er his white bones when they are bare-oh
The wind shall blow forever mair-oh

The Twa Corbies is a story of someone stumbling upon two crows wondering
what they should eat, and then they speak of a newly slain knight which
nobody knows where he is, and that his lady, hawk, and hound have all 
left him, and they are the only ones that know where he lies, but they
have all left and betrayed him, so there meal will be undisturbed.
The crows then go into detail about picking out his eyes, and using
his hair for their nest. Then they say that nobody will know where has
gone because all will be left is his white bones.

The stories origin is unknown but from around 1500. It is a story
of the loyalty of the knights hound, hawk and lady, and how they
so easily moved on and even may have betrayed him. And then showing
the fragiility of life as he was so easily slain and then left to die.

It was most likely his lady that killed him as she the only one that 
knew where he had died.
