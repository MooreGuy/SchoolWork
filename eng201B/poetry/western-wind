Western wind, when will thou blow,
The small rain down can rain?
Christ! If my love were in my arms,
And I in my bed again!

A very simple poem from 1500AD from an unknown author.

This poem was used to show how much information can be derived from
such a simple and small poem.

The speaker is waiting for a western wind, so he is most likely a sailor
and he also wishes for just a small ammount of rain, which is again
likely to be pointing to speaker being a sailor as he doesn't want a
storm, just a small rain.
Then he wishes that he was in his bed and his love were in his arms, 
probably meaning he was going to sleep with her.
